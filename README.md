// Mindset Assignment: Comfort with the Unknown

// So far in class, have you had any “aha” moments? What have you enjoyed the most? What has been the hardest?

// Answer:
// My biggest “aha” moment so far in class was when I finally understood how higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` work and how they simplify coding tasks. It felt like everything suddenly clicked! 
// I’ve really enjoyed working on practical assignments that show how to use these methods in real-world scenarios. It makes coding feel less abstract and more impactful.
// The hardest part has been debugging code that doesn’t work as expected. Sometimes it’s difficult to identify what’s wrong, and it can feel frustrating when I get stuck. However, I’ve learned to stay patient and use resources like documentation or mentors for help.

// What were you excited/worried about before class started?

// Answer:
// Before class started, I was excited about the opportunity to dive into coding and build tangible projects that I could showcase in a portfolio. 
// On the other hand, I was worried about whether I’d be able to keep up with the pace of the class and balance it with other responsibilities in my life. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to learn fast enough or retain all the information I’d need.

// How do you feel about what’s still to come in this class and in your journey ahead?

// Answer:
// I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness about what’s still to come in the class and my coding journey. 
// I’m excited because each week builds on the previous one, and I can see myself growing as a programmer. The thought of eventually creating full-fledged projects is very motivating.
// At the same time, I know the topics will get more complex, and I’m a bit anxious about the challenges ahead. Still, I’m confident that with persistence, curiosity, and the support of this class, I’ll be able to overcome any hurdles and achieve my goals.
